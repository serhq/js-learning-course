## üìö About

This repository contains my personal notes, code snippets, and mini-projects as I learn **JavaScript** ‚Äì the backbone of the web.

It's messy, experimental, and full of trial-and-error ‚Äî but that's the fun of it üòé



## üõ°Ô∏è Resources, apps

While learning a new programming language, I have a tendency to take notes and learn by doing via courses, documentation and AI tools.

Here's my top of resources I use for learning JavaScript:
- **Udemy** ‚Äî [The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Advanced](https://udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course) (it's used as a general course with full explanations, tasks and projects)
- **MDN JavaScript** ‚Äî [JavaScript | MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (it's useful for things you don't know and wish to explore apart from general courses)
- **YouTube** ‚Äî [BroCode Full JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfmg-EJ8gm4&t=454s&pp=ygUWamF2YXNjcmlwdCBmdWxsIGNvdXJzZQ%3D%3D) (only for revision, not as a general course)

I still recommend you using these resources to ensure you have learnt JavaScript and the main concepts of it (or any programming language). Don't rely only on ChatGPT or other AI tools.
